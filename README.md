Virtual CILamp
==============

A virtual CILamp implemented in Python using Tkinter.

Install
-------

Make sure you have Python 2.7 or 3.4+ on your system.

Also make sure you have Tkinter on your system. Simplest way to check that is probably:

    $ python
    >>import Tkinter  # If on 2.7
    >>import tkinter  # If on 3.x

If you can import Tkinter, you are most likely fine.

If on Windows, being able to start IDLE is a good check.


Run
---

In root of repository, type ./run.

If your on Windows, start a command prompt and type

    C:\gitrepos\vl\>python winlamp.pyw
